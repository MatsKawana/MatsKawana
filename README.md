### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Mats 
I'm a passionate Full-Stack Web Developer based in Montreal. 

I'm a tech enthusiast who is proficient in a wide range of programming languages and technologies including **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Node.js**, **React**, and **MongoDB**. I'm currently working through TypeScript and Next.js as part of my continuous learning journey.

With almost eight years of experience in advertising media for major brands, I bring a unique perspective to my work in web development that sets me apart from the rest. My background in advertising has instilled in me a deep appreciation for user experience and design, which I leverage in my work as a web developer to create compelling digital experiences that drive engagement and conversions. Whether it's building a new app from scratch or revamping an existing website, I approach every project with a strategic and user-focused mindset.

If you're looking for a talented, innovative, and collaborative Full-Stack Web Developer who is passionate about creating exceptional digital experiences, then I'm the perfect fit for your team.
